You have to download the Valorant color bot folder, and start the loader.bat, the loader only downloads python and downloads the necessary libraries and then starts the main.pyw file which is where the code is, you only have to do that the first time you use the cheat, then you can just double-click the main.pyw file, try to leave everything in the same folder to avoid errors.


Usage recommendations
The color you choose in the menu, must be the same color you have set as the enemy highlight.

Use small FOV, the default FOV is 6, very good.

Use the maximum fps possible in the cheat, so it is faster.

Set the trigger key as the second shooting option in valorant.

Aim well, these types of cheats are to aim in an area and when the enemy passes you can kill it automatically, you also have to be careful since for example if you have the purple color on, and you have the activation key pressed and you see something purple that is not an enemy it is likely that the cheat will shoot, for example that happens with queen's orbs
